\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this note is to determine the utility of single-qubit magic states for performing multi-qubit operations.
All this may already be known, but I'm not looking it up, for whatever reason. 
I start with a review of single-qubit gate teleportation, then try to phrase this protocol as a joint measurement protocol.
I conclude (I hope) by generalising this protocol to multi-qubit measurements. 
\section{Review}
Here's the well-known protocol for implementing a $T$ gate using Clifford operations and state preparation:

To show that this circuit does what it's supposed to, we can do a little math:
\begin{flalign}
\ket{\psi_{\mathrm{init}}} &= \left( \ket{0} + \exp \left( \frac{i\pi}{4} \right) \ket{1} \right) \otimes \left( \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1} \right) = \alpha \ket{00} + \beta \ket{01} + \alpha \exp\left( \frac{i\pi}{4} \right) \ket{10} + \beta \exp\left( \frac{i\pi}{4} \right) \ket{11} \\
\mathrm{CNOT}\ket{\psi_{\mathrm{init}}} &= \alpha \ket{00} + \beta \ket{01} + \alpha \exp\left( \frac{i\pi}{4} \right) \ket{11} + \beta \exp\left( \frac{i\pi}{4} \right) \ket{10} \nonumber \\
&= \left(\alpha \ket{0} + \beta \exp \left( \frac{i\pi}{4} \right)  \right) \otimes \ket{0} + \left( \alpha \exp \left( \frac{i\pi}{4} \right) \ket{1} + \beta \ket{0}\right) \otimes \ket{1} \\
&= \left(\alpha \ket{0} + \beta \exp \left( \frac{i\pi}{4} \right)  \right) \otimes \ket{0} + S^{-1}X\left(\exp \left( \frac{-i\pi}{4} \right)\alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}\right) \otimes \ket{1}
\end{flalign}
If we measure the bottom qubit, obtaining $0$ or $1$, the post-selected states are equivalent up to a global phase after applying the classically-controlled $XS$. 

%Bad writing:
To try to generalise this protocol, it might be useful to phrase it in terms of joint Pauli measurements.
\section{Joint Measurement Protocol}
If we propagate the measured operator $Z_1$ back through the \cnot, we get a joint $Z_0Z_1$. 
Measuring this operator projects either into the space spanned by $\set{\ket{00},\, \ket{11}}$ or $\set{\ket{01},\, \ket{10}}$. 
At this point, we could do the classically-controlled Clifford before we do the \cnot, but it's tough to see the general principle at work. 

Though, maybe you could disentangle by measuring an $X$ or something.

\section{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Taking a look at Daniel Gottesman's thesis, near equation 5.23, it looks like there's a state that can be prepared from post-selected joint Pauli measurement that facilitates a Toffoli gate. It would be interesting to see if this can be extended to other fixed-parity multi-qubit states, and what the resource count looks like. \textbf{Response:} don't you need some kind of multi-control $Z$ to get that state?
\item Can you get a $T$ gate from a Toffoli gate? I remember there being some conversion in Nielsen/Chuang, but it was between the Toffoli gate and some other fancy angle. 
\end{enumerate}
