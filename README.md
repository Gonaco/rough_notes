# rough_notes
When I was an undergrad, I worked for a professor who has a drawer full of research problems that he can offer to new students. I'm going to try to do something similar here. 

## Goals
I want these notes to be a little bit pedagogical, but not to the point of being introductory. 
I will try to remove notes which concern problems which I no longer find interesting.
For solved problems, I may leave the note up with the solution of the whole thing remains interesting. 
If you've found a solution to one of these problems, or you think you have an approach, feel free to e-mail me or send a pull request.  

## Caveat
These notes may be untested, and may have errors.
They might also contain problems solved elsewhere using better methods. 

## Double Hashtags
Instead of putting these notes in subfolders, I'll include little CamelCase tags in the source which are searchable.
The format of these tags is `##SubjectName`, a (probably partial) list follows:

 + `##OpenQuantumSystems` 
 + `##Solved` for notes which are mainly complete (there may be some open questions at the end, but the main body contains a result)
 + `##FaultTolerantOperations`
 + `##MagicStates`
 + `##Teleportation`
