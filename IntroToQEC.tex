\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this note is to help introduce quantum error correction [QEC] and (especially) fault-tolerance to people who are not familiar with quantum mechanics, or quantum computing, such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item undergraduates,
\item electrical/computer/software engineers,
\item experimental physicists now trying to implement QEC, who have missed such an introduction.
\end{itemize}
My goals in writing this note are:
\begin{itemize}
\item to keep it short, at the cost of completeness,
\item to refer to longer/superior works where possible (often),
\item to frequently compare ``scary quantum'' processes with their classical equivalents, to help de-mystify QEC.
\end{itemize}
[Insert usual caveat about imprecise notation, i.e.: these notes are free, and you get what you pay for.]

I begin in the following section with an explanation of why error correction is necessary, moving on to describe the difference between error-correction and fault-tolerance, before moving on to the most popular elements of QEC theory (stabilizer codes $\mapsto$ CSS codes $\mapsto$ homological codes $\mapsto$ the surface code). 
\section{Why Error Correction?}
If you meet a software engineer in the street, the need for error correction may not be obvious. 
In the life of a computer programmer, errors are things caused exclusively by people, and careful thinking and good practices are required to prevent, detect and correct them. 
[Maybe there's a repetition code at work here, especially with \texttt{diff}, but that is an analogy for another day.]
