\section{Introduction}
The toric/surface code is typically defined with weight-4 stabilisers of the form $XXXX$ and $ZZZZ$. 
This code detects $X$ and $Z$ errors independently, which can be a problem if the $Y$ error rate is large (which is the case if the code is actually detecting amplitude damping), or if the $X$ and $Z$ error rates are different, potentially leading to different logical error rates (though the gates involved in syndrome measurement may `un-bias' the noise for you). 
To remedy this, we can take advantage of the fact that any set of stabilisers which differs from the surface code stabilisers by a transversal unitary, which we will restrict to be a Clifford (though I don't think it has to be a Clifford, in principle).

There are two popular modifications, one which exchanges $ZZZZ$ stabilisers for $YYYY$ stabilisers, and one which acts a Hadamard on half the qubits, resulting in stabilisers of the form $XZZX$ and $XZXZ$.
We might even combine these to obtain $XYYX$/$XYXY$ stabilisers, if $X$/$Y$ error rates differ, or if it offers some advantage in terms of the independent $Z$ error rate that's on due to dephasing. 
The question we address in this document is how to measure these operators onto a bare ancilla. 
We apply a general principle, that stabiliser measurement is equivalent to phase estimation, except that we know the phase is $\pm 1$ in advance.
The syndrome measurement circuit is therefore:

Using circuit identities, we can express this circuit using the experimentally available gate set.
This is the origin of the $Y_{90}$/\textsc{cphase}-based implementations we often use in superconducting qubits. 
Let's try the same thing with the operators $YYYY$ and $XXYY$:

\section{Open Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Can you prepare a nice state using codes that differ from the toric/surface code by a transversal (perhaps non-Clifford) unitary?
